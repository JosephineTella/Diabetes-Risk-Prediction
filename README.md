# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction
Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, posing serious health challenges if not detected early. Timely diagnosis and risk prediction are essential for effective management and prevention of complications. In this project, machine learning techniques are applied to develop predictive models capable of identifying individuals at risk of diabetes based on key health and lifestyle factors such as age, BMI, blood glucose levels, and smoking history.

This study presents the development of a robust machine learning framework for predicting the onset of diabetes in individuals based on health and lifestyle data. The methodology incorporates comprehensive data preprocessing, including missing value imputation, normalization of numerical features, and encoding of categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies that may inform predictive modeling. Multiple supervised learning algorithms—including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—are trained, with hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation employed to optimize performance. Model evaluation is conducted using established metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score

As a supportive component of the methodology, feature importance analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are applied to enhance interpretability and provide transparency in model decision-making. These techniques assist in identifying the most influential predictors of diabetes onset, offering supplementary insights for clinical interpretation. The anticipated outcome is the development of a reliable and interpretable predictive model that facilitates early risk identification, supports preventive interventions, improves healthcare resource allocation, and contributes to reducing the global burden of diabetes.
