# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction
Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, posing serious health challenges if not detected early. Timely diagnosis and risk prediction are essential for effective management and prevention of complications. In this project, machine learning techniques are applied to develop predictive models capable of identifying individuals at risk of diabetes based on key health and lifestyle factors such as age, BMI, blood glucose levels, and smoking history.

This study presents the development of a robust machine learning framework for predicting the onset of diabetes in individuals based on health and lifestyle data. The methodology incorporates comprehensive data preprocessing, including missing value imputation, normalization of numerical features, and encoding of categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies that may inform predictive modeling. Multiple supervised learning algorithms—including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—are trained, with hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation employed to optimize performance. Model evaluation is conducted using established metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score

As a supportive component of the methodology, feature importance analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are applied to enhance interpretability and provide transparency in model decision-making. These techniques assist in identifying the most influential predictors of diabetes onset, offering supplementary insights for clinical interpretation. The anticipated outcome is the development of a reliable and interpretable predictive model that facilitates early risk identification, supports preventive interventions, improves healthcare resource allocation, and contributes to reducing the global burden of diabetes.

# Problem Statement
Diabetes mellitus is one of the fastest-growing chronic diseases worldwide, leading to severe health complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. Despite significant advances in healthcare, many individuals remain undiagnosed until symptoms become severe. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on laboratory testing after clinical signs have appeared, which limits early detection and prevention.

Machine learning provides an opportunity to address this gap by identifying hidden patterns in health data that can predict diabetes risk at an early stage. However, the challenge lies in selecting the most effective model that achieves high accuracy and generalization while minimizing false predictions. This project, therefore, seeks to evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the most reliable model for diabetes prediction based on key health indicators.

# Significance of the Study

•	    Early Detection: Enabling timely medical intervention and lifestyle changes before the onset of severe symptoms.

•	    Data-Driven Decision-Making: Supporting clinicians with predictive insights derived from historical health data.

•	    Model Optimization: Identifying the most accurate and interpretable model to improve diagnostic precision.

•	    Resource Efficiency: Reducing the cost and time associated with traditional screening methods.

•	    Public Health Impact: Contributing to preventive medicine efforts by helping identify high-risk individuals in the population.

Ultimately, this research emphasizes the potential of artificial intelligence and data science to transform healthcare through predictive analytics and evidence-based solutions

# Methodology Overview

This project followed a structured machine learning workflow designed to ensure accurate and reliable diabetes prediction. The process involved data collection, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and comparison of multiple algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

•	Data Collection:
The dataset used for this study was obtained from a reliable health database containing medical attributes relevant to diabetes prediction. These included features such as glucose level, body mass index (BMI), insulin level, blood pressure, age, and other diagnostic variables used as predictors, with diabetes status as the target variable.

•	Data Preprocessing:
The dataset was carefully examined for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Missing data were handled using appropriate imputation techniques, and feature scaling was applied to standardize numerical values. The data was then split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

•	Model Development:
Several machine learning algorithms were trained and tested on the dataset, including: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Each model was optimized using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best predictive accuracy and generalization.

•	Model Evaluation:
Model performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall (Sensitivity), and F1-Score. Confusion matrices were generated to visualize true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates. Cross-validation was also applied to ensure the models’ stability and consistency.

•	Model Comparison and Selection:
The models were compared based on their mean accuracy, F1-score, and generalization performance.
